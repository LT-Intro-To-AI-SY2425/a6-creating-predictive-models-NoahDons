# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
The  squared coefficient for my model was .88. This means the model showed a strong corelation between price age and miles.
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
my model is relatively accurate. Although it isn't perfect and is still quite off sometimes, the model can consistently give a general idea of what a car is worth within a reasonable estimate.
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
the first is estimated to be 9151 dollars and the second is 2089 dollars.
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
If the relationship between age and milage for the price of the car are decreasing linear, then at some point the best fit line would dip into the negatives if the price and age go high enough.
