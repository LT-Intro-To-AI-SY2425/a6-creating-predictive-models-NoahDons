# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value is how accurate the model is with 1 being perfect accuracy and 0 being no accuracy. The score of .625 says that making predictions based on the model would be pretty innaccurate but better than nothing.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
The predicted blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old is 136.52

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
The model's predictions are not very accurate. It is definately not accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure. This is because the range of data falls far above the line of best fit for some points and far below for others. Something that could improve the model is to recieve much more data to make the average more accurate.
