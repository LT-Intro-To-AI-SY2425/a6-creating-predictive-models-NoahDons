# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective because you can compare the predicted values to the actual values to see if the model is accurate based on real data.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared coefficient is quite low at only about .611 which means the model is not very accurate.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

The model is not accurate. The differences in blood pressures from the predicted and actual values are off by quite a large margin. For example, my model predicted a person that is 44 years old would have a blood pressure of 137.6 when the actual value was 160. This is a huge margin when dealing with something that needs to be so precise such as blood pressure.
